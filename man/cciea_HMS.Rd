This index shows modeled spawning stock biomass of bigeye tuna from the latest stock assessment report, which was completed through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), using Stock Synthesis V3. The assessment assumes that there is one stock of bigeye in the eastern Pacific. However, the assessment report acknowledges that recent tagging research suggests that bigeye undertake extensive longitudinal movements, which may be at odds with this assumption. The latest assessment report is available from www.iattc.org/Meetings/Meetings2017/JUL/PDFs/Docs/_English/IATTC-92-04a_The-fishery-in-2016-and-status-of-the-tuna-and-billfish-stocks.pdf; This index represents modeled spawning potential biomass from the latest (2017) stock assessment report, completed through the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC). North Pacific albacore are considered to be one stock throughout the North Pacific Ocean, although some studies have suggested that a northern and southern stock may be present within the assessment area. They are fished throughout their range by multiple countries, mostly using surface gear (troll and pole and line), as well as pelagic longlines and other gears. Their population dynamics are assessed using an age-, length- and sex-structured model (Stock Synthesis v3). The full assessment is available from http://isc.fra.go.jp/reports/stock_assessments.html.; Skipjack tuna are assumed to comprise one contiguous stock throughout the Pacific ocean. In the eastern Pacific, they are primarily fished in tropical waters, using purse seine gear. Skipjack are difficult to assess with standard stock assessment methods, due to high and variable productivity, and uncertainties in natural mortality and growth. This species is thus assessed using a simple model which generates indicators of biomass, recruitment and exploitation rate, and compares these to historically observed values (Maunder & Deriso 2007). The stock assessment is completed through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). The relative biomass index shown is from the latest update assessment, including data up to 2016, which is available from www.iattc.org/Meetings/Meetings2017/JUL/PDFs/Docs/_English/IATTC-92-04a_The-fishery-in-2016-and-status-of-the-tuna-and-billfish-stocks.pdf; Estimates of recruitment are derived from the assessment model.

The 2017 stock assessment was an update of the 2016 full assessment. Yellowfin tuna are assessed through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), using Stock Synthesis V3. They are assumed to comprise one stock throughout the Pacific, although tagging data suggest considerable regional fidelity. In the eastern Pacific, they are primarily fished in tropical waters, from Baja California south.

Pacific bluefin are considered to be one stock throughout the Pacific Ocean, and are fished throughout their range by multiple countries and fishing gears.

Swordfish are considered to comprise two stocks in the North Pacific. The western and central Pacific stock is located throughout the entire North Pacific, except for off Baja California, and central and south America, which is occupied by the eastern Pacific stock. The highest catches are from pelagic longline gears. The population dynamics of both stocks are assessed using a Bayesian state-space generalized surplus production model.
