Commercial shipping - distance: source data: Domestic vessel data from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Navigation Data Center (New Orleans, LA) and foreign vessel data from http://www.ndc.iwr.usace.army.mil/data/dataclen.htm ., additional calculations: Commercial shipping activity (distance) was measured as the distance traveled by commercial vessels during transit within waters of the California Current. Distance traveled was calculated using distance traveled within the California Current while in transit between shipping and receiving ports; Finfish Aquaculture: source data: Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife, Commercial Harvest Data Team, additional calculations: Finfish aquaculture was measured as the production of finfish from aquaculture operations that are located in marine waters. Only the State of Washington currently operates net-pen farms for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar).; Nutrient Input: source data: We used county-level data from 1987 - 2006 and state-level data from 2007 - 2010 from the U.S. Geological Survey (Ruddy et al. 2006, Gronberg and Spahr 2012; http://water.usgs.gov/lookup/getspatial?sir2012-5207_county_fertilizer) and nationwide data (1945 - 2001;  Ruddy et al. (2006)) to develop an index for the California Current across the longer time series., additional calculations: Nutrient input was measured using a normalized index of total nitrogen and phosphorus input from agricultural fertilizers used within watersheds that drain into the California Current.; Oil And Gas Activity: source data: Oil production data come from annual reports of the California State Department of Conservation's Division of oil, gas, and geothermal resources (ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/../pub/oil/annual_reports/), while natural gas production come from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_prod_sum_dcu_rcatf_a.htm)., additional calculations: Oil and gas activities were measured using a normalized index combining the production of oil and natural gas occurring in offshore sites of California.; Seafood Demand: source data: Data can be found in NOAA's annual Fisheries of the United States reports (http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/publications.html)., additional calculations: Seafood demand was measured as total consumption or utilization of edible and non-edible fisheries products across the entire United States. We used data from the entire United States as seafood from the California Current is consumed and utilized at national, and even international scales.; Seafood Demand Per Capita: source data: Data can be found in NOAA's annual Fisheries of the United States reports (http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st1/publications.html)., additional calculations: Seafood demand was measured as total consumption or utilization of edible and non-edible fisheries products across the entire United States. We used data from the entire United States as seafood from the California Current is consumed and utilized at national, and even international scales.; Shellfish Aquaculture: source data: Data were retrieved and summed together from Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's Commercial Harvest Data Team, Oregon Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Fish and Game., additional calculations: Shellfish aquaculture was measured as the estimated production of shellfish from aquaculture operations in the states of Washington, Oregon and California.; Bottom trawl contact with seafloor habitat (weighted): source data: Distances were summed within physiographic depth, habitat and ecoregion categories from logbook data provided by the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center and is comparable to the data developed for NOAA's Essential Fish Habitat 5-year Synthesis Review in 2013 (maps and data available: http://efh-catalog.coas.oregonstate.edu/overview/, additional calculations: Habitat modification was measured using the total distance disturbed by trawling and fixed (longlines and pots) gear. Straight line distances between start and end points for trawling gear and between set and retrieval points for fixed gear were calculated for each gear type and weighted by the gear type's impact to the bottom habitat and by the type of habitat. These weightings come from NOAA's 5-year Synthesis Review of West Coast Groundfish (Supplemental Table A3a.2); Groundfish landings (w/o hake) WA: source data: Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN; http://pacfin.psmfc.org/), additional calculations: Groundfish (without Pacific hake (Merluccius productus)) landings (1000's of metric tons) in Washington.
