\description{
Source Data: Various; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5. For Oregon and Washington ESUs, data were obtained from the NWFSC's "Salmon Population Summary" database (https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/sps), with additional data for Oregon Coast coho salmon (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, https://oregonstate.edu/dept/ODFW/spawn/data.htm), and from PFMC (2012) for the Upper Columbia Summer/Fall-run Chinook Salmon. Additional Calculations: Abundance indices are calculated as longterm anomalies (observed mean/standard deviation) of annual escapement by natural origin coho salmon in the lower Columbia River ESU (Clackamas and Sandy Rivers; see Wells et al. 2014, Table S5). Data series for multiple subpopulations were standardized by subtracting the series mean and dividing by the series standard deviation. If a consolidated index for the stock was needed we computed an annual weighted average of the standardized series, with weights proportional to the average abundance for each subpopulation.
