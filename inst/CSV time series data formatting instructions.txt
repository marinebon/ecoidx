CSV time series data formatting instructions


When submitting IEA data, please submit a CSV file with the following column titles:
 
year
index
SEup
SElo
metric
timeseries
 
year - the year.  this can also be a date if your data are sub yearly
index - these are the data to graph.  Could be fish biomass  or el nino
SEup - upper SE bound, if available
SElo - lower SE bound, if available
metric - descriptor of the index, eg CPUE kg/km2
timeseries - the name of the time series, eg, Sealion pup count or aragonite saturation at station NH05
 
This format will match the plotting function and allow for more easy automation or the report production.
 
You can include multiple time series in one file, just name them differently in the time series column. 
 
You can also include additional columns (SE, SD etc) or leave out any of the above except year,index, timeseries, and metric.
